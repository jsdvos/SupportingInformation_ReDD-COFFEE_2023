PXRD obtained from Fig. 1 and converted to numerical data with WebPlotDigitizer (https://apps.automeris.io/wpd/)
The lower angle values are obtained from the full PXRD, as these are not present in the detailed inset.
The higher angle values are obtained from the detailed inset, as this has a higher resolution.
The split value is the lowest angle value obtained from the detailed inset.
